## Description

This is a fun little project for a class of mine at CU Boulder. The goal is
to create a web game that allows for a fun way to learn about Tardigrades.
Build with <3 and [phaser](https://phaser.io/), the game can be played at
[here](https://learnitall.github.io/tardirave/).

## How To Play

You play as a Tardigrade whose goal is to collect food or water, which are the
plant and water droplets on the screen. When a resource is collected, your
health and score will increase. Your health and score is displayed in the upper
left corner of the screen.

To move, touch or click on a position in the screen. A target will appear and
your tardigrade character will accelerate towards it.

To make the game more interesting, there are enemies that appear on the screen
as well. There are the nematode and amoeba images. They will move around
randomly. If you collide with an enemy, your health will drop.

If your health drops too low, you'll enter a tun state. Tardigrades enter
into a tun state when their water content drops too low; it is what allows
them to survive extremely dry conditions for extended periods of time. In
tun state, you are not allowed to move, and must run into a drop of water
in order to revive.

If all of the food items on the screen are collected, you move onto the next
level, which will contain more food items and more enemies. The goal is to
get the highest score possible.
