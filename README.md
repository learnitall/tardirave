## Description

This is a fun little project for a class of mine at CU Boulder. The goal is
to create a web game that allows for a fun way to learn about Tardigrades.
Build with <3 and [phaser](https://phaser.io/), the game can be played at
[here](https://learnitall.github.io/tardirave/).

## How To Play

You play as Thomas the Tardigrade, living in the cool waters of a Rocky
Mountain lake. Thomas isn't the best at gathering food, so it's your job
to help him out. Help Thomas collect food and water, which are the
plant and water droplets on the screen. When a resource is collected, Thomas'
health and score will increase. Thomas' health and score is displayed in the
upper left corner of the screen.

To move Thomas, touch or click on a position in the screen. A target will appear
and your Thomas will accelerate towards it.

Be careful! There are enemies that appear on the screen as well. There are
the nematode and amoeba images. They will move around randomly. If Thomas
collides with an enemy, his health will drop.

If Thomas' health drops too low, he'll enter a tun state. Tardigrades enter
into a tun state when their water content drops too low; it is what allows
them to survive extremely dry conditions for extended periods of time. In
tun state, Thomas can't move on his own and instead must be pushed around.
Push Thomas into a water droplet in order to revive him.
in order to revive.

If all of the food items on the screen are collected, you move onto the next
level, which will contain more food items and more enemies. The goal is to
get the highest score possible.
